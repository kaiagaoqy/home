# Qingying Gao (Kaia) 高清滢
**ABOUT ME:**

I am a second-year master student in the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. 

I am a member of the **Lions Vision Research & Rehab Center**, Wilmer Eye Institute and **Artificial Intelligence for Engineering and Medicine Lab**. I am advised by Prof. Yingzi Xiong and Prof. Rama Chellappa.

My research interest lies in multi-modality fusion, 2D and 3D segmentation, as well as human-computer interaction, especially in clinical applications.
